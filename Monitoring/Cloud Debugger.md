# Cloud Debugger

Cloud Debugger is a feature of Google Cloud Platform that lets you inspect the state of an application, at any code location, without stopping or slowing down the running app. Cloud Debugger makes it easier to view the application state without adding logging statements.

You can use Cloud Debugger with any deployment of your application, including test, development, and production. The debugger adds less than 10ms to the request latency only when the application state is captured. In most cases, 
this is not noticeable by users.
