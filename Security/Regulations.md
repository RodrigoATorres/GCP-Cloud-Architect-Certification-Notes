https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/#tab8

- The GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, replaced the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive.
- lays out specific requirements for businesses and organizations who are established in Europe or who serve users in Europe
- It:
  - Regulates how businesses can collect, use, and store personal data
  - Builds upon current documentation and reporting requirements to increase accountability
  - Authorizes fines on businesses who fail to meet its requirements

If you partner with Google Cloud, we will support your GDPR compliance efforts by:

### Google Cloud and the GDPR
Committing in our contracts to comply with the GDPR in relation to our processing of customer personal data in all Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace services
  - Offering additional security features that may help you to better protect the personal data that is most sensitive
  - Giving you the documentation and resources to assist you in your privacy assessment of our services
  - Continuing to evolve our capabilities as the regulatory landscape changes

### STANDARDS & CERTIFICATIONS
Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform undergo several independent third-party audits on a regular basis to provide this assurance:
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)
- ISO/IEC 27017 (Cloud Security)
- ISO/IEC 27018 (Cloud Privacy)
- ISO/IEC 27701 (Privacy Information Management)
- SSAE18/ISAE 3402 (SOC 2/3)
  - The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) SOC 2 (Service Organization Controls) and SOC 3 audit framework defines Trust Principles and criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality


## PCI DSS

### PCI Security Standards Council
- The PCI Security Standards Council is a global forum for the ongoing development, enhancement, storage, dissemination, and implementation of security standards for account data protection
  - established by the major credit card associations (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB) as a separate organization to define appropriate practices that merchants and service providers should follow to protect cardholder data
  - It is this council of companies that created the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS).

### PCI DSS

- set of network security and business best practices guidelines
- establish a “minimum security standard” to protect customers’ payment card information
- The scope of the PCI DSS includes all systems, networks, and applications that process, store, or transmit cardholder data, and also systems that are used to secure and log access to the systems in scope
- Google Cloud undergoes an annual third-party audit to certify individual products against the PCI DSS
  - This means that these services provide an infrastructure upon which customers may build their own services or applications which store, process, or transmit cardholder data.
  - customers are still responsible for ensuring that their applications are PCI DSS compliant
